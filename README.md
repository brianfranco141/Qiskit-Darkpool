# Dark-Pool-Orderbook-detection

This Qiskit program uses the Alpaca Trade API to retrieve information about the order flow and price of a stock, and it uses a quantum circuit to estimate the likelihood of the stock price going up. If there are dark pool orders being placed for the stock and the likelihood of the stock price going up is above a certain threshold, the program places a buy order for the stock. If the likelihood of the stock price going up is below the threshold, the program places a sell order for the stock.
