This Qiskit program uses the Alpaca Trade API to detect dark pool orders for a specific option contract, identify the destinations of those orders, and execute trades based on this information. If dark pool orders are detected, the code uses a specified trading strategy (either "quantum" or "momentum") to determine whether to buy or sell the option contract. If the "quantum" strategy is used, the code uses a VQC to make predictions about the likelihood of the option price going up or down, and then makes a trade accordingly. If the "momentum" strategy is used, the code uses the momentum of the option contract to make a trade.
